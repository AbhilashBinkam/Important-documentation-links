1. How to remove duplicate rows from X table?

NOTE: PARTITION BY -- divides the query result set into partitions

   Let's create a common table expression. 
with EmployeeCTE As (select *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by ID order by ID) as RowNumber from Employee);

Delete from EmployeeCTE where RowNumber > 1;

2. Method Overriding Exception handling criteria?
3. Future Object in Callable Interface?
4. Object.clone() concepts?
5. HashMap and concurrentHashMap Difference?
6. 
		char c;
		int i;
		c = 'B';		// 1
		i = c;		//2
		System.out.println(i);
	//	c = i + 1;	//3
	//	c++;		//4
	
o/p: error at line 3 ; what is the value of i? --> i = 66(ASCII). while performing the operation we need to cast the char to Integer

7. If we create an object reference i.e Sample sam  = new Sample(); then the default values get initialized to variables i.e. for String null, and for int 0 and for boolean false.
without creating an object and we didn't initialize any value... and we used in any place of the program then we get compile time error.
